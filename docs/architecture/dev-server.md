# The dev server

`pyxle dev` is the command you'll spend the most time with. It runs a
Starlette ASGI app on port 8000, a Vite subprocess on port 5173, an
SSR worker pool, an incremental compiler, a file watcher, and a
WebSocket error overlay — all coordinated as a single async program.

This doc explains how those pieces fit together. By the end you'll
understand what every line in the startup banner means, what happens
when you save a file, and how to read the dev server's source code.

**Files (`pyxle/devserver/`):**

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `__init__.py` (~290) | The `DevServer` class and the top-level lifecycle |
| `starlette_app.py` (~820) | Creates the Starlette ASGI app and routers |
| `settings.py` (~150) | The frozen `DevServerSettings` config object |
| `scanner.py` (~100) | Walks `pages/` and computes file content hashes |
| `builder.py` (~165) | Orchestrates one incremental build pass |
| `watcher.py` (~350) | Watches the filesystem and debounces events |
| `vite.py` (~370) | Spawns and supervises the Vite subprocess |
| `proxy.py` (~155) | Forwards Vite-served URLs to Vite's port |
| `registry.py` (~380) | Loads compiled metadata into a `RouteTable` |
| `routes.py` (~280) | The `PageRoute` / `ApiRoute` / `ActionRoute` dataclasses |
| `layouts.py` (~295) | Generates layout-wrapped client modules |
| `overlay.py` (~105) | WebSocket overlay for error notifications |
| `error_pages.py` (~140) | Discovers `error.pyx` and `not-found.pyx` boundaries |
| `route_hooks.py` (~225) | Per-route middleware policies |
| `middleware.py` (~75) | Loads custom user middleware modules |
| `tailwind.py` (~300) | Optional Tailwind CSS watcher |
| `csrf.py` (~160) | CSRF protection middleware |
| `client_files.py` (~2170) | Bundled client runtime sources |
| `scripts.py`, `styles.py` | Global script and stylesheet resolution |

That's a lot. Most of it doesn't matter for understanding how the
dev server works at a high level. The key pieces are: the
**Starlette app**, the **builder**, the **watcher**, **Vite**, and
the **registry**. Everything else is supporting infrastructure
around those five.

You can read those lines in order against the seven steps above —
each `ℹ️` log is one piece of the lifecycle reporting that it's
done.

## The Starlette app

`create_starlette_app()` (`devserver/starlette_app.py:506`) is the
factory function that builds the entire ASGI application. It returns
a `Starlette` instance with:

### Routes

- **Page routes** (`build_page_router()`, line 291) — one Starlette
  `Route` per `PageRoute` in the route table. Each route has a
  closure handler that knows which page to render.
- **API routes** (`build_api_router()`, line 187) — one Starlette
  endpoint per `pages/api/*.py` file. Functions named after HTTP
  methods (`get`, `post`, etc.) get registered for those methods;
  a function named `handle` gets all methods.
- **Action routes** (`build_action_router()`, line 363) — POST-only
  endpoints under `/api/__actions/{name}` for every `@action`
  decorated function.
- **Static asset mount** (`build_client_assets_mount()`, line 498)
  — serves `/client/*` and `/dist/*` directly from disk.
- **Public files mount** (`build_static_files_mount()`, line 485)
  — serves whatever's in `public/`.
- **Health endpoints** — `/healthz` and `/readyz` for orchestration.
- **Catch-all 404** — walks up the request path looking for the
  nearest `not-found.pyx` boundary.
- **WebSocket route** at `/__pyxle/overlay` — used by the dev
  overlay client.

### Middleware stack

Listed from outermost to innermost (outermost runs first on request,
last on response):

1. **GZip** — production only
2. **CORS** — if `cors` is configured in `pyxle.config.json`
3. **CSRF** — if `csrf.enabled` is true in config
4. **`StaticAssetsMiddleware`** — short-circuits requests for
   `/client/*` and public assets so they don't reach the page router
5. **Custom user middleware** — anything declared in
   `pyxle.config.json` `middleware: ["mymodule:MyMiddleware"]`
6. **Vite proxy** — dev only, forwards JS/CSS/HMR requests to Vite

The middleware stack is built in `create_starlette_app()` line
~668. Each middleware is added with `Middleware(...)` and Starlette
chains them in order.

### Lifespan hooks

Starlette has a `lifespan` callback that runs on startup and
shutdown. Pyxle uses it to:

- **Start the SSR worker pool** on startup
- **Stop the worker pool gracefully** on shutdown (give workers 5
  seconds to exit cleanly, then kill any holdouts)

This means workers are alive for the lifetime of the dev server,
not per-request.

---

## The incremental builder

`build_once()` (`devserver/builder.py:50`) is the function that
runs **one build pass** — initial compile, or rebuild after a file
change. It:

1. **Scans `pages/`** with `scanner.scan_source_tree()` to find
   every `.pyx`, `pages/api/*.py`, and client asset file. For each
   file, it computes the SHA256 hash of the contents.
2. **Compares hashes against the previous build's metadata** to
   find which files actually changed since last time.
3. **Compiles only the changed `.pyx` files** by calling
   `compile_file()` for each. Unchanged files are left alone.
4. **Copies API modules** (`pages/api/*.py`) to their build location.
5. **Composes layouts** for any pages whose ancestor `layout.pyx`
   files have changed (`layouts.compose_layout_templates()`).
6. **Syncs global stylesheets and scripts** declared in the config.
7. **Removes orphaned artifacts** for source files that have been
   deleted since the last build.
8. **Returns a `BuildSummary`** dataclass with counts: pages
   compiled, APIs copied, etc.

The hash-based diffing is the key to performance. A typical 50-page
project has *thousands* of unchanged files at any moment; running
the parser on every one of them on every save would be wasteful.
With hash diffing, a single-file edit triggers exactly one
`compile_file()` call.

Source: `devserver/builder.py:50-160`.

### When does a layout-only change trigger a page rebuild?

Layouts are tricky: when you edit `pages/dashboard/layout.pyx`,
**every page under `pages/dashboard/`** needs its composed route
module regenerated. The composed module is what bundles the layout
with the page, so it needs to be re-emitted whenever the layout's
identity changes.

The builder handles this by recompiling layouts first, then
re-running the layout composition pass for any page whose ancestor
layout was rebuilt. This is invisible to you — you save the layout,
and a moment later the affected pages reload in the browser.

---

## The watcher

`ProjectWatcher` (`devserver/watcher.py:101`) wraps Python's
`watchdog` library to observe filesystem events. It's structured as:

1. A **watchdog observer** running in a background thread, posting
   raw events to a queue.
2. A **debounce buffer** that aggregates events for 250ms (the
   default; configurable). Saving a file twice in quick succession
   only triggers one rebuild.
3. A **dispatch callback** that the dev server registers; the
   watcher calls it with the set of changed paths after the debounce
   window expires.

The dispatch callback runs `build_once()` and then refreshes the
metadata registry. If the build fails (e.g., a parser error), the
watcher captures the exception and broadcasts it to the WebSocket
overlay so the browser can display the error inline.

### Module cache invalidation

When a `.pyx` file's *Python half* changes, the dev server's existing
imported version of the compiled `.py` is stale. Python's import
system caches modules in `sys.modules` — re-importing the same module
key returns the cached version.

The watcher purges the cached module from `sys.modules` after every
rebuild, so the next request that needs it triggers a fresh import.
Source: `devserver/watcher.py:286`.

This is why Python edits show up immediately without restarting the
dev server. The hot-reload story is: write file → watcher fires →
incremental build → module cache purged → next request reads the
new code.

### What's watched

By default, the watcher observes:

- `pages/` — recursive
- `public/` — recursive
- Any file referenced in `globalStyles` or `globalScripts` config
- The `pyxle.config.json` itself (changing the config triggers a
  full restart, not a hot-reload)

It does **not** watch `node_modules/`, `.pyxle-build/`, `dist/`, or
any dotfiles. Those are either output directories (changing them
would loop) or noise.

---

## Vite integration

`ViteProcess` (`devserver/vite.py:21`) supervises the Vite dev
server subprocess. The Vite process is responsible for:

- Bundling JSX for the browser (with React Refresh / HMR)
- Serving static assets from `.pyxle-build/client/`
- Handling client-side hot module replacement when JSX files change

Pyxle's dev server **does not** serve JS/CSS to the browser
directly. Instead, it **proxies** asset requests to Vite's port.
This sounds inefficient but it isn't: the proxy just forwards bytes,
and Vite is the JS expert.

### Spawning Vite

`ViteProcess` tries several command resolutions to find Vite:

1. `node_modules/.bin/vite` — local install via npm
2. `node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js` — local install, called via
   `node`
3. `npx vite` — fallback if neither local install exists

Each candidate is validated with `--version` before being committed
to. If Vite isn't installed at all, Pyxle automatically runs
`npm install` to restore dependencies. (This is also why a fresh
`pyxle init` works on the second `pyxle dev`: the first attempt
notices the missing dependencies and installs them.)

Source: `devserver/vite.py:225`.

### Readiness probing

After spawning Vite, Pyxle polls Vite's TCP port (default 5173)
every 100ms until it accepts connections. Once it does, Vite is
"ready" and Pyxle starts serving page requests. The whole readiness
window is usually under a second.

If Vite takes longer than 10 seconds to come up, Pyxle reports a
timeout and shuts down — usually a sign that something else is
holding port 5173.

### Auto-restart

If the Vite subprocess exits unexpectedly (crashes, OOMs, gets
killed), Pyxle's monitor coroutine catches the exit and schedules a
restart after 0.5 seconds. The restart probes for readiness again
and re-attaches to the proxy.

This is invisible during normal use but essential for long dev
sessions: it keeps Vite running across edits to its config, plugin
errors, and Node version mismatches without requiring you to
restart the dev server.

Source: `devserver/vite.py:302`.

### The proxy

`ViteProxy` (`devserver/proxy.py:40`) is a small ASGI middleware
that forwards specific URLs to Vite. It matches:

- Anything ending in `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.mjs`, `.css`,
  or `.map`
- Anything starting with `/@vite/` (Vite's internal endpoints)
- `/@react-refresh` (the HMR endpoint)

For matching requests, it uses `httpx.AsyncClient.stream()` to
forward chunks without buffering, so a 5MB CSS file doesn't get
loaded into Pyxle's memory before being sent to the browser. Headers
are filtered to drop hop-by-hop fields.

For non-matching requests, the middleware passes through to the
next layer (the page/API router).

---

## The metadata registry

`MetadataRegistry` (`devserver/registry.py`) is the in-memory map
from route paths to `PageRoute` / `ApiRoute` / `ActionRoute`
objects.

`build_metadata_registry()` (line 118) walks
`.pyxle-build/metadata/` and reads each `.json` file. For every
page, it constructs a `PageRoute` containing:

- The route path (primary)
- Any alias paths (from optional catch-all routes)
- Paths to the server module, client module, and metadata
- The Python module key for `importlib`
- Loader name and line number
- Static head metadata
- Action metadata

The dev server then iterates the registry to register Starlette
routes. After every rebuild, the registry is **rebuilt from scratch**
— Pyxle never tries to incrementally patch the registry, because
the cost of a full rebuild is small (millisecond range for typical
projects) and the correctness is much easier to reason about.

### Layout head discovery

A layout's `<Head>` JSX block contributes to every page below it.
At registry-build time, `find_layout_head_jsx_blocks()` walks
ancestor directories of each page looking for `layout.pyx` (and
`template.pyx`) metadata, collects their `head_jsx_blocks`, and
attaches the merged list to the page's `PageRoute`. The SSR
pipeline reads this at request time without re-parsing.

Source: `devserver/registry.py:337`.

---

## The error overlay

`OverlayManager` (`devserver/overlay.py:24`) maintains a set of
WebSocket connections from browser tabs. When the dev server has
something to tell the browser — a build error, a runtime error, a
successful rebuild — it broadcasts a JSON message to every
connected client.

Event types:

- `"error"` — sent when a build fails or a runtime error occurs.
  Includes the error message, stack, and "breadcrumbs" describing
  which stage of the request pipeline failed (loader, render, head
  evaluation, etc.).
- `"clear"` — sent when a previously-failing route succeeds. The
  client uses this to dismiss any visible error overlay.
- `"reload"` — sent after a successful rebuild. The client triggers
  a soft reload of the current page.

The browser-side overlay client lives in `pyxle/client/` and is
included in the default scaffold.

---

## How a request flows through the dev server

Putting everything together, here's what happens when the browser
asks for a page in dev mode:

```
GET /dashboard
   │
   ▼
ASGI app (Starlette)
   │
   ▼
1. Static asset middleware
   "Is /dashboard a file in /client/ or /public/?"
   No → pass through
   │
   ▼
2. CORS / CSRF middleware (if enabled)
   "Is the request allowed?"
   Yes → pass through
   │
   ▼
3. Custom user middleware (if any)
   "Anything to do here?"
   No → pass through
   │
   ▼
4. Vite proxy
   "Does /dashboard look like a Vite asset?"
   No → pass through
   │
   ▼
5. Page router
   "Is /dashboard in the route table?"
   Yes → invoke the page handler closure
   │
   ▼
6. Page handler
   - Look up the PageRoute
   - In dev mode, purge stale modules from sys.modules
   - Call the SSR pipeline (build_page_response)
   │
   ▼
7. SSR pipeline (see ssr.md)
   - Run loader
   - Resolve head
   - Render component on a worker
   - Assemble document
   - Stream response
   │
   ▼
HTML response → browser
```

The browser then loads `/client/...` URLs for the JS bundle, which
hit the static asset middleware and get forwarded to Vite via the
proxy. Vite serves them, and React hydrates.

---

## What the dev server is *not*

Let me list a few things the dev server explicitly does **not** do,
because the absences are part of the design:

- **It doesn't bundle JS itself.** Vite does. Pyxle is a Python
  framework that proxies a JavaScript bundler — it doesn't try to
  out-Vite Vite.
- **It doesn't watch your `node_modules/`.** Adding a dependency
  requires `pip install` (Python) or `npm install` (JS) followed by
  a manual `pyxle dev` restart. We could watch them, but it would
  triple the watcher's event volume for marginal value.
- **It doesn't have its own caching layer.** The render cache lives
  inside the SSR worker (esbuild caches its bundles). The metadata
  cache is the registry. There's no application-level cache.
- **It doesn't guess about routes.** Every route comes from a real
  file on disk. There is no `routes.py` or `urls.py` you can
  manipulate at runtime.
- **It doesn't have a "production mode" toggle in dev.** `pyxle dev`
  is dev. `pyxle serve` is production. They are different commands
  for different lifecycles, and trying to make one mode mimic the
  other usually papers over real differences.

These absences are deliberate. The dev server is meant to be small
enough that you can read it cover to cover in an afternoon and
understand exactly what it does.
