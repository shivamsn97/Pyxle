"""AST-driven parser that splits ``.pyx`` files into Python and JSX segments.

The parser is purely AST-driven: no fence markers, no string-based
directives, no per-line heuristics. The Python/JSX boundary is found
by walking the source greedily with :func:`ast.parse` — at each cursor
position the parser tries to grow the largest valid Python prefix; if
none is possible, it grows a JSX segment until Python resumes. This
cleanly handles arbitrary alternation of Python and JSX blocks
(``python | jsx | python | jsx | ...``) in any order, including
JSX-first files, single-section files, empty files.

The parser exposes a structured syntax error reporting mechanism:
``PyxDiagnostic`` entries on ``PyxParseResult.diagnostics``, populated
in tolerant mode so IDEs and ``pyxle check`` can surface every error
per file at once instead of stopping at the first.
